1) public static void main(String args[])

public -access modifier
static -access modier
void it is a return type
String is a data typeenclosed with paranthesis
args it is a variable name



2) class is a template or a blueprint where states and behaviour are used.
state are used to represent the variable and behaviour used to represent method.
class consist of the class name .

Object is instatnce of a class which is used in a runtime.
It can be initialzed by a new keyword.
the syntax of the object is 
ClassName referencevariable =new Classname();
classname()==>This is refered as constructor.

3) JVM is defined java virtual machine where jvm is platform independent.
jvm performs specific task
1)load the code 2) verify the code 3) execute the code
It also provide runtime environment to the jre.
jvm contains 1)code loader-where it takes the byte code ,load the code and send it to the byte code verifier.
              2)byte code verifier- where it checks whether we violate any security while writing the code.
              3)interpreter-the interpreter checks the code line by line. and send it to the decline of the code.
2)JRE it is a combination of the jvm and set of libraries.
It is a platform dependent .
The abbrevation java runtime environment.
3)JDK it is java development kit.
   jdk is combination of the jre and development tools.
it contains the source code and the byte code .
where the source code will have the code where it will compile the code and send it to the byte code.

2)class ReverseNo1{

public static void main(String a[]){
		
		int num[]={1,2,3,4};
		for(int i=num.length;i>0;i--){
			System.out.println(num[i]);
		}
		
		
		}
}



3)class Reverse{

public static void main(String a[]){
		String name="program";
		int count=0;
		
		char ch[]=name.toCharArray();
		for(int i=ch.length-1;i>=0;i--){
		
		
		System.out.print(ch[i]);
		}
		
		
		}
}



4)
     The constructor is a special type of a method to intialize the variable without any return time.
the syntax will be :Classname()
The constructor have 2 types:
1) Default constructor :the constructor without having any of the parameters.
        sysntax==>           public  ClassName(){
                             }
2)Parameterized constructor: the constructor having list of parameters inside the paranthesis.
        Syntax==>     public ClassName(String "",int 6){

                      }




5)  
    this is a keyword used to initialize and to show the parameter and the instance variable having the same variable name.
       public  int Id;
       public  String name;
public Patient(int Id,String name){
this.Id=Id;
this.name=name;

}



6)
       Static is a access modifier where the access modifier have intialize the data type inside the paranthesis by default it will take the 
data types as static . 


There are two method types:

UserDefined method:
THe method which has to be written by the user while writing the program.

Predefined method:
The method which is already exists in the java file.




8) The java class loading perform two operation,in which it contains the source code and byte code.
Source code will have the code and while compiling it , it move to the byte code with the help of the compiler where byte is the only one platform dependent.
   then it move to the jvm and there jvm contains code loader .
==>java class loaders verfies the byte code .which having any error in syntax and symmantics.



9).no we cannot have private construct because if the constructor become private we cannot run the code in tester it will be disabled.
We can make the variables as private .



10)

class ArrayLength{
       static int num[]= {12,3,2,45,6,7,6};

		public static void main(String arg[]){
		
                System.out.println(num.length);
		
		}
}





11)No we cannot use the instance variable inside the static method,Because instance variables are used in the objects declaration
 where it will having the constructor where we have to define all the instance variables.Static are used to declare in the method declaration.
